# Why PostCSS?

I normally use SCSS for my projects but PostCSS looks better at the moment. In theory, PostCSS can do all of the same things and more. Let's see.

# Webpack setup

First, let's install the dependencies:

```
npm install --save-dev postcss-loader postcss precss css-loader mini-css-extract-plugin postcss-preset-env
```

In webpack.config.js, add rules to support CSS files and `CopyWebpackPlugin` to generate a CSS fileâ€”all PostCSS code gets concatenated (joined) into one file.

```js
const HubSpotAutoUploadPlugin = require('@hubspot/webpack-cms-plugins/HubSpotAutoUploadPlugin')
const CopyWebpackPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin')
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin')

module.exports = ({ account, autoupload }) => ({
  //...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: [
          MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
          {
            loader: 'css-loader',
          },
          {
            loader: 'postcss-loader',
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    //...
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
      filename: 'css/styles.css',
    }),
    //...
  ],
})
```

Create a new CSS file at `src/styles.css`. Add it as an import to the top of `src/index.js` so that Webpack includes it as a dependency.

```js
import './css/styles.css'
```

If you want to include regular CSS files (for example all the boilerplate CSS files), you can add `{ from: 'src/css', to: 'css' },` to the `CopyWebpackPlugin` patterns array.

You also need to add to create a `postcss.config.js` file in the root of your project to manage plugins.

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    precss: {}, // adds most SCSS features to CSS
  },
}
```

That's it!

Now you can write CSS like:

```css
$blue: #056ef0;
$column: 200px;

.menu {
  width: calc(4 * $column);
  .menu_link {
    background: $blue;
    width: $column;
  }
}

/* which becomes */

.menu {
  width: calc(4 * 200px);
}

.menu .menu_link {
  background: #056ef0;
  width: 200px;
}
```
