# Why Tailwind?

Tailwind takes a utility-first approach to CSS. It's slowly chipping away at the "best practice" of using semantic CSSâ€”I'm mostly convinced. See if [this article](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/) changes your mind.

Make sure you review the documentation, tweak things, and really take time to understand how everything works. This set up was only lightly tested.

# Getting started

The next steps depend on [part one](/blog/hubspot-webpack/getting-started) and [part two](/blog/hubspot-webpack/add-postcss) of this series.

# Install dependencies

```
npm install -save-dev tailwindcss@latest
```

# Tailwind config

Add a `tailwind.config.js` file to the root of your project.

```js
// in tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  mode: 'jit', // critical to working in Hubspot
  purge: ['./src/**/*.html'],
  darkMode: false,
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

# PostCSS config

Add the tailwind plugin to your PostCSS plugins list.

```js
// in postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    precss: {},
    tailwindcss: {},
  },
}
```

# Your CSS

Include Tailwind in your `src/styles.css` file.

```css
/* ./src/css/styles.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
