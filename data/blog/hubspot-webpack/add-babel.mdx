# Why Babel?

Babel lets you write modern JS and then converts it down to JS that all browsers understand.

# Install

```
npm install --save-dev babel-loader @babel/preset-env
```

# Webpack Config

Update the webpack.config.js to choose a [devtool option](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/main/examples/source-map) and set a loader for js files.

Here's the full webpack config for easy reference:

```js
const HubSpotAutoUploadPlugin = require('@hubspot/webpack-cms-plugins/HubSpotAutoUploadPlugin')
const CopyWebpackPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin')
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin')

module.exports = ({ account, autoupload }) => ({
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'js/main.js',
  },
  devtool: 'cheap-source-map',
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            presets: ['@babel/preset-env'],
          },
        },
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: [
          MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
          {
            loader: 'css-loader',
          },
          {
            loader: 'postcss-loader',
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new HubSpotAutoUploadPlugin({
      account,
      autoupload,
      src: 'dist',
      dest: 'your-theme-name-here-three',
    }),
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
      filename: 'css/styles.css',
    }),
    new CopyWebpackPlugin({
      patterns: [
        { from: 'src/theme.json', to: 'theme.json' },
        { from: 'src/fields.json', to: 'fields.json' },
        { from: 'src/images', to: 'images' },
        { from: 'src/modules', to: 'modules' },
        { from: 'src/templates', to: 'templates' },
      ],
    }),
  ],
})
```

# Tell Webpack about your JS

Add `import './js/main.js';` to the top of your `src/index.js` file. This tells Webpack where to start when it's building the dependency graph.

```js
import './css/styles.css'
import './js/main.js'
```

# Tell Babel which browsers you want to support

`@babel/preset-env` looks at the `browsersList` in your `package.json` file to determine which version of JS it should transpile down to.

```json
  "browserslist": [
    "last 2 versions",
    "> 5%",
    "IE 11",
    "IE 10"
  ]
```

You're all set. The next post will cover a include nested JS files (like those in modules) without having to include all of your JS on every page.
