# The minimal setup

The rest of this post assumes you are comfortable working with Hubspot, have at least Node 12.x installed (I like to manage Node versions with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)) and use Terminal to run commands.

First, let's make sure you have the latest version of the [Hubspot CLI](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/cms/developer-reference/local-development-cli) installed. Run the following command in Terminal:

```
npm install -g @hubspot/cli@latest
```

## Start with the Hubspot boilerplate

We'll use the Hubspot CLI to create a new website theme in a local folder. If any of this seems confusing at this point switch to the [Hubspot quick start guide](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/cms/guides/getting-started?hsCtaTracking=28bfd0e9-ec05-48a5-b069-ce20015f54ac%7Cc66b91fb-14b1-4c35-ab0d-7e4af8000592). Otherwise, continue with the following steps:

**1.** Make a new local directory named 'my-hubspot-theme' and switch into it. In Terminal run:

```
mkdir my-hubspot-theme && cd my-hubspot-theme
```

**2.** Create a new boilerplate Hubspot theme in a new src folder and name your project 'cool-project-name'. In Terminal run:

```
hs create website-theme src
```

## Connect your local folder to Hubspot

Use the Hubspot CLI to generate a hubspot.config.yml file that connects your local files to your Hubspot account. In Terminal run:

```
hs init
```

## Basic project setup

While you’re at it, you’ll eventually need a package.json file — now is a good time to create one. In Terminal run:

```
npm init
```

Initializing a git repo is always a good idea too. In Terminal run:

```
git init
```

An index.js file will be necessary to customize your webpack config. In Terminal run:

```
touch src/index.js
```

## Install the required dependencies

We'll eventually add more packages (and features) but these are the ones you need to get started: In Terminal run:

```
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli copy-webpack-plugin @hubspot/webpack-cms-plugins
```

☑️ webpack (to bundle assets)

☑️ webpack-cli (to manage webpack commands)

☑️ copy-webpack-plugin (to copy files from your /src folder to a /dist folder)

☑️ @hubspot/webpack-cms-plugins (to move local files to your remote Hubspot account)

## The smallest webpack configuration

Create a file name webpack.config.js in your root directory. Copy pasta the code below.

```js
const HubSpotAutoUploadPlugin = require('@hubspot/webpack-cms-plugins/HubSpotAutoUploadPlugin')
const CopyWebpackPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = ({ account, autoupload }) => ({
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'js/main.js',
  },
  plugins: [
    new HubSpotAutoUploadPlugin({
      account,
      autoupload,
      src: 'dist',
      dest: '<your-project-folder-in-hubspot-here>',
    }),
    new CopyWebpackPlugin({
      patterns: [
        { from: 'src/theme.json', to: 'theme.json' },
        { from: 'src/fields.json', to: 'fields.json' },
        { from: 'src/css', to: 'css' },
        { from: 'src/images', to: 'images' },
        { from: 'src/modules', to: 'modules' },
        { from: 'src/templates', to: 'templates' },
      ],
    }),
  ],
})
```

Whatever you name `<your-project-folder-in-hubspot-here>` will appear as your theme folder in `Design Tools` in Hubspot.

You can do a lot more with webpack but this is just a start.

## How to run webpack

Add a `start` script in `package.json` so that you don’t have to keep typing webpack — watch — mode etc etc etc.

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "webpack --watch --mode development --env autoupload",
}
```

```
npm start
```

When you run `npm start` in Terminal, a series of amazing things happen.

The following might be too much information at the moment but understanding each step really helps make webpack easy to work with.

1. Environment variables are passed to webpack.config.js (`account` is pulled from hubspot.config.yml and `autoupload` defaults to true).
2. Webpack starts to build its dependency graph starting from `/src/index.js`
3. Webpack creates a folder named `/dist` (by default) and outputs code into `/dist/js/main.js`.
4. Webpack plugins start to run from the bottom up (in reverse).
5. `CopyWebpackPlugin` copies all `/src` files into the `/dist` folder
6. `HubspotAutouploadPlugin` syncs each file that moves through webpack into the Hubspot destination folder that you set.
7. Webpack watches for changes. It loops through steps 2 through 6 each time a file is saved.

In part two, we start with the basic setup and start to add more interesting features. Check back soon!
